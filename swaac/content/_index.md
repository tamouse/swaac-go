# Introduction to this edition of my dev blog swaac.dev

Over the years, I've been keeping notes and writing things down about stuff I've learned, stuff I want to share, and so on. In the never-ending quest to learn new things, I've also re-organized and repurposed this collection so many times.

**A caveat**: this collection of notes is largely personal learning; it is by no means authoritative, canonical, complete, or even necessarily accurate. These are notes that represent the best of my understanding and my own understanding at the time I captured them. If you find something wrong, confusing, or want to ask a question, leave a comment, please!


## What is SWaaC? Software as a Craft!

I am a firm believer that software development is primarily a craft, that is, it involves skills, knowledge, creativity, problem-solving and critical thinking skill, and a deeply personal desire to make things.

I [wrote a post on this](./posts/2013/08/programmers-creativity.md) back in 2013:

> I think most people think programming is cold, precise, and mechanical. It's actually creative, perplexing and deeply personal. &#x2014; Unknown (from [Discordian Quotes](http://discordianquotes.com/quote/think-people-thing-programming-cold-precise-mechanical-actually))

I've said similar words many times. I wish more people understood them.

What does it mean to be creative? It usually means making something that other's can see as beautiful, or as unique, but also it means applying your mind to making something real that exists only at first in your mind.

Several of the posts you'll find here were originally in my personal blog and copied over here. I've decided what I really want is a curated set of my writing on SWAAC, so here we are.
