# Ruby, Rails and Friends #

*'The language people love, and the web application framework people hate'*

A server-side language that also makes a good scripting language.

*******

Ruby and Ruby on Rails have been my primary practice area for the past 12 years or so, since 2006.

Recently, I switched to doing a lot of frontend development in React, along with using Apollo Client and GraphQL. I've maintained a lot of work in both Ruby and Rails, writing the backend GraphQL server for the application I work on.

Ruby is also my language of choice for writing tools these days, taking up from my heavy use of Perl.
