## Books on Ruby ##

If you can only afford one book to start with, go with the _Well-Grounded Rubyist_ as it has the most introductory material.

Otherwise, get them **all**.

### [Well-Grounded Rubyist](http://www.amazon.com/The-Well-Grounded-Rubyist-David-Black/dp/1617291692) by David A. Black ###

Also known as the "Black Book" \(because of the author's name\), WGR is the successor to _Ruby for Rails_ by Black that provided me with the much-needed introduction to how to write Ruby code, with the idea of using it in Ruby for Rails. This book is a fabulous primer on the Ruby idioms and expressions that help make one a good Ruby programmer.

### [Eloquent Ruby](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9364729-eloquent-ruby) by Russ Olsen. ###

Olsen's approach in this book is to go far beyond just learning a programming language, but a way to learning the idioms and the "Ruby Way". Even if your chosen language is something other than Ruby, reading this book will give you an appreciation for how to delve into a language and get the most out of it.

### [Confident Ruby](http://www.confidentruby.com/) by Avdi Grimm. ###

More than any other book I've read on Ruby, "Confident Ruby" has affected my coding habits more than any other. If Ruby is about making programmers happy, _Confident Ruby_ is about making programming joyful, and not just in the immediate, but being able to look at code you've written in the future and recall the joy. _Confident Ruby_ seeks to combat software rot from the get-go.

## Books on Rails ##

### [Rails 4 in Action](http://www.manning.com/bigg2/) by Ryan Bigg, Yehuda Katz, Steve Klabnik, and Rebecca Skinner. ###

A follow-on the highly successful Rails 3 in Action, R4iA has been completely rewritten, with new examples, case study, and all the great new features in Rails 4.

A great book for beginning Rails developers to start with, and for intermediate developers to step up their game.

There is no book for version 5 and as far as I know, none planned for Rails 6. That said, there is much useful information and guidance in this book on how to approach building a Rails app.

### [Practicing Rails](https://www.justinweiss.com/practicing-rails/) by [Justin Weiss](http://www.justinweiss.com). ###

The first chapter alone \(free!\) is worth a download and very thorough read. Justin has provided one of the most effective strategies for learning just about _anything_ skill based, and it's especially effective for learning software skills. The focus of the book and the examples and such are obviously Rails, but the first chapter is applicable to anything.
